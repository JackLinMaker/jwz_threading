Website: http://fdietz.wordpress.com/projects

This is jwz_threading, a library implementing the JWZ E-Mail threading 
algorithm as described by Jamie Zawinski (http://www.jwz.org/doc/threading.html).

It is a small ruby library which lets you order a list of E-Mails by conversation.
That is, grouping messages together in parent/child relationships based on which 
messages are replies to which others.

There is an IMAP extension Internet Draft available which decribes
the same here:
